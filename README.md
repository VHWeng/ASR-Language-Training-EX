## Testing

The application can be tested by running it directly:

```bash
python main.py
```

Verify functionality by:
- Creating and loading your own vocabulary files
- Testing speech recognition with different engines
- Practicing pronunciation training features
- Verifying image loading from ZIP archives
- Testing flashcard mode with vocabulary

## Local Git

To save your changes to the local git repository, use the following commands:

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes with a message
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# Check the status of the repository
git status
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Media Handling
**Image Loading Failures**
- ✅ Validate ZIP structure (images/ subdirectory)
- ✅ Confirm supported formats (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif)
- ✅ Verify column 6 contains correct relative filenames
- ✅ Check file permissions and path encoding
- ✅ Ensure images are properly referenced in vocabulary files for flashcard display

**Audio Recording Issues**
- ✅ Grant microphone permissions to Python/application
- ✅ Test audio drivers and system sound settings
- ✅ Adjust energy threshold in application settings
- ✅ Ensure no other applications are using the microphone

#### Performance Optimization
**Slow Processing**
- ✅ Use Google Speech Recognition for fastest processing
- ✅ Close other resource-intensive applications
- ✅ Consider using smaller Whisper models (tiny, base) for older hardware

#### File Compatibility
**Vocabulary Loading Errors**
- ✅ Verify CSV encoding (UTF-8 recommended)
- ✅ Check delimiter consistency throughout file
- ✅ Ensure required columns are present
- ✅ Validate ZIP file integrity

### Debug Information
The application provides detailed status messages in the status text area at the bottom of the window.
